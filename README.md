[Why Web UI Development Is So Hard?](https://itnext.io/why-web-ui-development-is-so-hard-a88c47f4b3c5)

## My thoughts on this

Developers, especially new ones, often focus on the "happy path," the ideal user journey. But real-world scenarios involve complicated unexpected errors and user behaviors. The fact that users can and will find ways to use a system in unanticipated manners means that developers must be proactive, not just reactive. This requires designing UIs with robustness and flexibility in mind, anticipating those "unhappy paths" before they become issues. Besides, developers must handle both local and remote state: local as in if a button is clicked by user, remote as in if the app requests data from server. 

This is an informative article that gives a glimpse of what makes UI development so difficult.

Thanks for sharing the article. I agree with you and the article on that UI development is not a easy path. Like mentioned in the article, the error message are tricky and sometimes we used a lot of external techonologies that we may not be a master of.

That being said, I am grateful to read this article because it gave me a thorough angle on what we are doing right now.
